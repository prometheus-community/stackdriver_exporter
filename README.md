# Google Stackdriver Prometheus Exporter
[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/prometheus-community/stackdriver_exporter.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/prometheus-community/stackdriver_exporter)

A [Prometheus][prometheus] exporter for [Google Stackdriver Monitoring][stackdriver] metrics. It acts as a proxy that requests Stackdriver API for the metric's time-series everytime prometheus scrapes it.

## Installation

### Binaries

Download the already existing [binaries][binaries] for your platform:

```console
$ ./stackdriver_exporter <flags>
```

### From source

Using the standard `go install` (you must have [Go][golang] already installed in your local machine):

```console
$ go install github.com/prometheus-community/stackdriver_exporter
$ stackdriver_exporter <flags>
```

### Docker

To run the stackdriver exporter as a Docker container, run:

```console
$ docker run -p 9255:9255 prometheuscommunity/stackdriver-exporter <flags>
```

### Cloud Foundry

The exporter can be deployed to an already existing [Cloud Foundry][cloudfoundry] environment:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/prometheus-community/stackdriver_exporter.git
$ cd stackdriver_exporter
```

Modify the included [application manifest file][manifest] to include the desired properties. Then you can push the exporter to your Cloud Foundry environment:

```console
$ cf push
```

### BOSH

This exporter can be deployed using the [Prometheus BOSH Release][prometheus-boshrelease].

## Usage

### Credentials and Permissions

The Google Stackdriver Exporter uses the Google Golang Client Library, which offers a variety of ways to provide credentials. Please refer to the [Google Application Default Credentials][application-default-credentials] documentation to see how the credentials can be provided.

If you are using IAM roles, the `roles/monitoring.viewer` IAM role contains the required permissions. See the [Access Control Guide][access-control] for more information.

If you are still using the legacy [Access scopes][access-scopes], the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring.read` scope is required.

### Flags

| Flag                              | Required | Default | Description |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `google.project-id`               | No       | GCloud SDK auto-discovery | Comma seperated list of Google Project IDs |
| `monitoring.metrics-ingest-delay` | No       |         | Offsets metric collection by a delay appropriate for each metric type, e.g. because bigquery metrics are slow to appear |
| `monitoring.metrics-type-prefixes` | Yes      |         | Comma separated Google Stackdriver Monitoring Metric Type prefixes (see [example][metrics-prefix-example] and [available metrics][metrics-list]) |
| `monitoring.metrics-interval`     | No       | `5m`    | Metric's timestamp interval to request from the Google Stackdriver Monitoring Metrics API. Only the most recent data point is used |
| `monitoring.metrics-offset`       | No       | `0s`    | Offset (into the past) for the metric's timestamp interval to request from the Google Stackdriver Monitoring Metrics API, to handle latency in published metrics |
| `monitoring.filters`              | No       |         | Formatted string to allow filtering on certain metrics type |
| `web.listen-address`              | No       | `:9255` | Address to listen on for web interface and telemetry |
| `web.telemetry-path`              | No       | `/metrics` | Path under which to expose Prometheus metrics |

### Metrics

The exporter returns the following metrics:

| Metric | Description | Labels |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ |
| `stackdriver_monitoring_api_calls_total` | Total number of Google Stackdriver Monitoring API calls made | `project_id` |
| `stackdriver_monitoring_scrapes_total` | Total number of Google Stackdriver Monitoring metrics scrapes | `project_id` |
| `stackdriver_monitoring_scrape_errors_total` | Total number of Google Stackdriver Monitoring metrics scrape errors | `project_id` |
| `stackdriver_monitoring_last_scrape_error` | Whether the last metrics scrape from Google Stackdriver Monitoring resulted in an error (`1` for error, `0` for success) | `project_id` |
| `stackdriver_monitoring_last_scrape_timestamp` | Number of seconds since 1970 since last metrics scrape from Google Stackdriver Monitoring | `project_id` |
| `stackdriver_monitoring_last_scrape_duration_seconds` | Duration of the last metrics scrape from Google Stackdriver Monitoring | `project_id` |

Metrics gathered from Google Stackdriver Monitoring are converted to Prometheus metrics:
* Metric's names are normalized according to the Prometheus [specification][metrics-name] using the following pattern:
  1. `namespace` is a constant prefix (`stackdriver`)
  2. `subsystem` is the normalized monitored resource type (ie `gce_instance`)
  3. `name` is the normalized metric type (ie `compute_googleapis_com_instance_cpu_usage_time`)
* Labels attached to each metric are an aggregation of:
  1. the `unit` in which the metric value is reported
  3. the metric type labels (see [Metrics List][metrics-list])
  4. the monitored resource labels (see [Monitored Resource Types][monitored-resources])
* For each timeseries, only the most recent data point is exported.
* Stackdriver `GAUGE` and `DELTA` metric kinds are reported as Prometheus `Gauge` metrics; Stackdriver `CUMULATIVE` metric kinds are reported as Prometheus `Counter` metrics.
* Only `BOOL`, `INT64`, `DOUBLE` and `DISTRIBUTION` metric types are supported, other types (`STRING` and `MONEY`) are discarded.
* `DISTRIBUTION` metric type is reported as a Prometheus `Histogram`, except the `_sum` time series is not supported.

### Example

If we want to get all `CPU` (`compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu`) and `Disk` (`compute.googleapis.com/instance/disk`) metrics for all [Google Compute Engine][google-compute] instances, we can run the exporter with the following options:

```
stackdriver_exporter \
  --google.project-id my-test-project \
  --monitoring.metrics-type-prefixes "compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu,compute.googleapis.com/instance/disk"
```

Using extra filters:

```
stackdriver_exporter \
 --google.project-id my-test-project \
 --monitoring.metrics-type-prefixes='pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription' \
 --monitoring.filters='pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription:resource.labels.subscription_id=monitoring.regex.full_match("us-west4.*my-team-subs.*")'
```

## Filtering enabled collectors

The `stackdriver_exporter` collects all metrics type prefixes by default.

For advanced uses, the collection can be filtered by using a repeatable URL param called `collect`. In the Prometheus configuration you can use you can use this syntax under the [scrape config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#<scrape_config>).


```yaml
params:
  collect:
  - compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu
  - compute.googleapis.com/instance/disk
```
